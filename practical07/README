These are the codes for Practical 7.

1. finde.c
2. dynamicallocation.c

To compile

gcc -o dynamicallocation dynamicallocation.c -lm -Wall
gcc -o finde finde.c -lm -Wall

It can be noticed that the estimateion of e increases as the order of the polynomial increases. Howeve, fter a certain threshold velue, the estimation starts getting worse with increasing polynomial, which can happen because of machine precision. It might be that the value we are trying to calculate is not in bounds with the datatype of the variable.
